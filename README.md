# MAIS 202 - Application Coding Challenge

I chose the simple but effective route of using pandas and pyplot in conjunction with eachother to extract, treat, and display the data. This streamlined the process greatly and simplified my code immensely from my initial approach of using a standard CSV reader then trying to group and organize the data directly.

## Running instructions

This script is quite simple to use, just ensure you have installed pandas and matplotlib (in terminal use ```pip install pandas matplotlib```). With the libraries set up, ensure the data file is named "data.csv" and is located in the same directory as the script file you can, then run the script by navigating to the directory in which everything has been downloaded/saved and running ```python interestChallenge.py```.
